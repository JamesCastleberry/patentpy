# patent.py

To Test:
  * Use the file '25PatentsOld.xml' when asked what file to use when running the program 'convertsOldxml.py'.
  * Use the file '25PatentsCurrent.xml' when asked what file to use when running the program 'conversCurrentXML.py'
  * In both cases, a new CSV file will be made with the file name you choose.
  
  
* cited patents use Google search term (with country before patent # and "kind" after), so might not be searchable within USPTO
* patent applications will be included in cited patent list (searchable at https://patents.google.com)
